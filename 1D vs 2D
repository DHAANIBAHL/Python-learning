### 🟢 2️⃣ “Nested for loops appending directly”

This corresponds to:
`[[i, j] for i in L1 for j in L2]`

🔍 What’s happening?

* You do NOT create a new list inside the outer loop

* You directly append each [i, j]

* Everything goes into one single list
cartesian_product = []

for j in L2:                 # Outer loop
    inner_list = []          # 🔥 New list created each time
    
    for i in L1:             # Inner loop
        inner_list.append([i, j])
    
    cartesian_product.append(inner_list)  # Append whole list

for x in cartesian_product:
    print(x)


🟢 2️⃣ “Nested for loops with inner list”

This corresponds to:
`[[[i, j] for i in L1] for j in L2]`

🔍 What’s happening?

* For every j

* You build a separate list

* Then you add that list to the main list


cartesian_product = []

for j in L2:                 # Outer loop
    inner_list = []          # 🔥 New list created each time
    
    for i in L1:             # Inner loop
        inner_list.append([i, j])
    
    cartesian_product.append(inner_list)  # Append whole list
