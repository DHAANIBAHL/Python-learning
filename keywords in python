### 🐍 Python Keywords (Python 3)

Here is the complete list of Python keywords:

🔹 Functions & Scope

* lambda: Used to create an anonymous (one-line) function without using def

* yield: Used inside a function to make it a generator. It returns a value but pauses the function, allowing it to continue later.

* nonlocal: Used inside nested functions to modify a variable from the outer (but not global) function.

🔹 Exception Handling

* try: Defines a block where errors might occur.

* except: Catches and handles an error from the try block.

* finally: Block that always runs, whether an error occurred or not.

* raise: Used to manually throw an exception.

* assert: Used for debugging. Raises an error if the condition is False.

🔹 Deletion

* del: Deletes variables, list elements, or entire objects.

🔹 Asynchronous Programming

* async: Used to define an asynchronous function.

* await: Used inside an async function to wait for another async function to finish.

#Lambda 
# Normal function
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Lambda version
square_lambda = lambda x: x * x

print(square_lambda(5))  # Output: 25

# Yeild
def count_up_to(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        yield i

for num in count_up_to(3):
    print(num)

# Nonlocal
def outer():
    x = 10
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20
    
    inner()
    print(x)

outer()  # Output: 20

# Try & except
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except:
    print("Error occurred")

# Finally
try:
    x = 5
except:
    print("Error")
finally:
    print("This always runs")

# Raise
age = -5

if age < 0:
    raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")

# Assert
x = 5
assert x > 0   # No error

assert x < 0   # Raises AssertionError

# Del
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
del numbers[1]
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 3]


# Async
async def greet():
    return "Hello"

# Await
import asyncio

async def greet():
    return "Hello"

async def main():
    message = await greet()
    print(message)

await main()
