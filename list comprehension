# List Comprehension

# Imagine you’re a wizard 🧙‍♂️ and you need to make a custom potion (a new list) using ingredients (the elements in your original list). But here's the catch—you only want certain ingredients! Instead of going through the whole potion-making process one step at a time, you’ve got a magic spell (list comprehension) that helps you grab exactly what you want in one shot!

# [expression for item in iterable if condition]


# Let us see an example:
# You’ve got a list of numbers and you want to get the squares of only the even numbers. 

# Normal Way (a bit of a hassle):

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
squared_evens = []

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        squared_evens.append(num ** 2)

print(squared_evens)

# Magic Way (List Comprehension) 💫:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
squared_evens = [num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(squared_evens)

# 3x3 Matrix using Nested List Comprehension
matrix = [[i * j for i in range(1, 4)] for j in range(1, 4)]
print("3x3 Matrix (Multiplication Table):")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)  # Display each row for better readability

print("\n")

# Cartesian Product using List Comprehension
L1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
L2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

cartesian_product = [[i, j] for i in L1 for j in L2]
print("Cartesian Product (Pairs of L1 and L2):")
for pair in cartesian_product:
    print(pair)  # Display each pair for clarity

# List comprehension with a conditional expression is a compact way to create a new list by looping through an iterable and applying an if-else condition to each element — all in one line.

# It replaces a normal for loop + if-else block.
