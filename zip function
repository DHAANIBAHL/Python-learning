### ✅ Zip() function

zip() is a built-in Python function that combines two or more iterables (like lists, tuples, etc.) element-by-element based on their index and returns an iterator of tuples.

👉 It pairs the first elements together, second elements together, third elements together, and so on.

### 🧠 Key Points to Remember

- zip() → pairs elements by index

- Returns an iterator of tuples

- Can combine 2 or more iterables

- Stops at the shortest iterable

# Basic Example (Two Lists)

# Two lists with the same length
L1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
L2 = [-1, -2, -3, -4]

# zip() pairs elements index-wise:
# Index 0 → (1, -1)
# Index 1 → (2, -2)
# Index 2 → (3, -3)
# Index 3 → (4, -4)

zipped = zip(L1, L2)  # zip object (iterator)

# Convert to list to see the result
print("Zipped pairs:", list(zipped))
