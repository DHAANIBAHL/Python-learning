## iter() and next()
### 📌 1. iter()

iter() is a built-in Python function that:

Converts an iterable (like a list, tuple, string, etc.) into an iterator.

An iterator is an object that:

- Remembers its current position

- Returns one item at a time

- Moves forward each time you ask for the next value

### 📌 2. next()

next() is a built-in function that:

- Retrieves the next item from an iterator.

- Each time you call next(), it:

- Returns the next value

- Moves the iterator forward

If there are no more items, it raises: *StopIteration*

# Basic example

books = ["Book 1", "Book 2", "Book 3"]

# Convert the list into an iterator
book_iterator = iter(books)

# Fetch items one at a time using next()
print(next(book_iterator))  # First item → 'Book 1'
print(next(book_iterator))  # Second item → 'Book 2'
print(next(book_iterator))  # Third item → 'Book 3'

# What Happens If You Call next() Again?
print(next(book_iterator))

# It raises StopIteration
